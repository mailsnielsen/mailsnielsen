# 👋 Hi, I'm Mails Nielsen  

**Founder & CEO of [SolidProof.io](https://solidproof.io)** — a blockchain security firm helping Web3 projects earn trust through **smart contract audits, KYC, and automated on-chain verification.**

I’ve been working in IT since **2011**, starting out as a **DevOps Engineer and IT Consultant**, later evolving into a **Full-Stack Developer** and, for the past five years, focusing on **Web3, fintech, and cybersecurity**.

While I’ve worked across a wide range of technologies, I still proudly call myself a **PHP enthusiast** — though I also enjoy working with **JavaScript/TypeScript**, **Rust**, and **Solidity**.

My passion lies in **planning and delivering secure, scalable software solutions** for complex client projects. Having worked across multiple domains — from infrastructure and backend systems to blockchain and compliance automation — I’ve built up a **broad and deep technical toolkit**, allowing me to connect the dots between different disciplines.

Think of me as a *Swiss Army knife* for Web3 technology - bridging development, security, and compliance.

🧠 Currently exploring **Zero-Knowledge KYC attestations**, **cross-chain security automation**, and **real-time risk intelligence** within the [SolidProof TrustNet](https://app.solidproof.io) ecosystem.
